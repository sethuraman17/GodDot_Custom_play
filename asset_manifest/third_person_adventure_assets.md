environment_preprocessing_notes:
- Original texture-heavy GLBs were converted to lightweight prepared GLBs before Summer import.
- The wasteland pack was split into individual files before placement.
- Internal object, mesh, and material names were sanitized so raw source-pack names do not appear in the runtime scene tree.
- Official public use still needs final source URLs, licenses, and credits for every environment prop.
